  <h1 id="bio-header">Who's Hemthead?</h1>
  <p>
    Hi, I'm John Reed (@hemthead)!
    Some of my interests are:
    <ul>
      <li>Programming (Systems langs; rust on a good day)</li>
      <li>Math</li>
      <li>Homestuck (Eww, epilogues)</li>
      <li>Politics</li>
      <li>Indie Animation on YouTube (normie)</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    I like computers and programming, even though I'm not very good. 
    Usually I'm trying to do something in Rust but I also like C and I'm interested in all
    lower level computer programming concepts.
  </p>

      <h3>Programming</h3>
      <p>
        Perhaps my most pervasive interests (this site is self-made, after all), a good programming
        session is one of the best feelings; weeding through (my own) terrible logic and hopefully
        or working to understand a complicated (for me) concept is a gloriously fulfilling struggle.

      <h3>Art</h3>
      <p>
        Art is one of those thing's that I'm always <i>_thinking_</i> about getting better at /
        doing, but I'm rarely ever creating anything in practice.
      </p>
      <p>
        In terms of style, I'm really digging the aliased style (where you can see the pixels) of
        media such as Homestuck (yep)! I tend to draw small, square pieces (650x650 has been my
        spot), with pixel brushes to try to emphasize that.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've been using Krita for drawing, and the default PixelArt 16 palette has been proving
        pretty motivating; having such a restricted (and at times unideal) palette of colors to
        choose from really relieves the burden of choice and makes everything <i>_soo much
        easier_</i>. Perhaps I'll be making more art more quickly in the coming future (keep tabs on
        my tumblr for more punctual updates on the matter.
